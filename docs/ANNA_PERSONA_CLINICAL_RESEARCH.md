# Anna's Clinical Research Profile
## Comprehensive Data Foundation for 200-Day Demo Dataset

**Document Purpose**: This research compilation provides clinically-validated data ranges and patterns to create realistic demo data for "Anna" - a 30-year-old woman with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS).

---

## Anna's Profile Summary

| Attribute | Value | Clinical Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Name | Anna | Demo persona |
| Age | 30 years | Diagnosed at 20 (10-year disease history) |
| Gender | Female | Important: AS presents differently in women |
| Height | 178 cm | |
| Weight | 51 kg | BMI: 16.1 (underweight) |
| BMI Category | Underweight | Associated with worse disease activity in AS |
| HLA-B27 | Positive | ~90% of AS patients are HLA-B27+ |
| Disease Duration | 10 years | Past the initial 10-year progression peak |

### BMI Clinical Implications (Anna is Underweight)
- **Study findings**: Underweight AS patients have worse disease activity and functional outcomes
- **CRP association**: Low BMI patients with AS show higher inflammation markers (hsCRP 30.6 mg/L vs 8.4 mg/L in normal weight)
- **Treatment response**: Both underweight and obesity reduce biologic treatment response
- **Data implication**: Anna's BASDAI scores should trend slightly higher due to underweight status

## 15. 200-Day Data Generation Summary

### Timeline Overview
**Days 1-200** representing ~6.5 months of app usage

### Expected Events
| Event Type | Count | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Daily check-ins | 180-190 | 90-95% compliance |
| Major flares | 3-4 | Duration: 10-21 days each |
| Minor flares | 8-12 | Duration: 3-7 days each |
| Exercise sessions | 130-150 | 65-75% of target |
| Meditation sessions | 80-100 | 2-3x/week average |
| Biologic injections | 5 | Monthly |
| PRN NSAID days | 40-60 | During flares/bad days |
| Good days | 60-80 | BASDAI < 4 |
| Moderate days | 80-100 | BASDAI 4-5.5 |
| Bad days | 30-50 | BASDAI > 5.5 |

### Data Patterns to Implement

#### Weekly Rhythm
- **Monday**: Often harder (weekend rest → stiffness)
- **Mid-week**: Stabilization
- **Friday**: Fatigue accumulation
- **Weekend**: Variable (rest vs. activity)

#### Monthly Rhythm (Female)
- Potential hormonal influence on symptoms
- Week before menstruation: possible symptom increase

#### Seasonal Considerations
- If data spans multiple seasons: weather correlations
- Pressure drops: trigger flares 12-24h later

#### Medication Timing
- Biologic: Day 1, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196
- Slight improvement 2-7 days post-injection
- Possible wearing off 3-4 weeks post-injection

### Journal Entry Themes
- Frustration with chronic condition
- Gratitude on good days
- Weather observations
- Work/life impact
- Exercise achievements
- Sleep struggles
- Social limitations
- Hope/progress notes
