│   └── ASFlarePredictor.mlpackage (copied, 2.1MB)
├── Core/ML/
│   ├── NeuralEnginePredictionService.swift (created)
│   └── NeuralEngine/
│       ├── models/ASFlarePredictor.mlpackage (original)
│       └── src/
│           ├── enhanced_coreml_exporter.py (created)
│           └── coreml_compatible_export.py (created, working)
└── Features/AI/
    └── NeuralEnginePredictionView.swift (created)
```

## ⚠️ WHAT YOU MUST DO IN XCODE (5 Minutes)

**I cannot automate these 3 steps** because they require Xcode's IDE:

### Step 1: Add Model to Xcode (2 min)
- Drag `Resources/ML/ASFlarePredictor.mlpackage` into Xcode
- OR: Right-click project → "Add Files"

### Step 2: Add Swift Files (2 min)
- Add `NeuralEnginePredictionService.swift` to project
- Add `NeuralEnginePredictionView.swift` to project

### Step 3: Add Navigation (1 min)
- Add NavigationLink to Neural Engine view
- Could be in ContentView, TabView, or Settings

**FULL INSTRUCTIONS**: Open `SETUP_XCODE.md` (it's open in Xcode now!)
